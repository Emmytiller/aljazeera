      <p>The Muslim holy month of Ramadan will begin on Thursday. The pre-sunrise to sunset fast lasts anywhere from 12 to 18 hours, depending on where you are in the world. <br> <br>
       Muslims believe that Ramadan is the month when the first verses of the holy book Quran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years ago.</p> <hr> </div>

      <p>The fast entails abstinence from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual relations during daylight hours to achieve greater “taqwa”, or consciousness of God</p>
     <h2>Why does Ramadan start on different dates every year?</h2>
     <p>Ramadan begins 10 to 12 days earlier each year. This is because the Islamic calendar is based on the lunar Hijri calendar with months that are 29 or 30 days long. <br>
     This year, the first day of fasting in Mecca will be on Thursday, March 23, Saudi Arabia announced on Tuesday. <br> 
     Because the lunar year is shorter than the solar year by 11 days, Ramadan will be observed twice in the year 2030 – first beginning on January 5 and then starting on December 25. <br>   The next time Ramadan will start after March 23 will be 33 years from now – in the year 2056.</p>
